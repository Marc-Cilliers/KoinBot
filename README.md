## About

KoinBot is a Discord bot used to fetch and display cryptocurrency data with a focus on speed. It currently makes use of the [serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) rust wrapper for the Discord API and the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation) for fetching cryptocoin market data.
